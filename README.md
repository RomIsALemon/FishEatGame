# FishEatGame
 
A godot project I had started, loosely based on Feeding Frenzy and those fake ads with the fish eating smaller fish to become a larger fish. 
I programmed the movement, eating mechanics, camera movement relative to the fish's size, and even a dash mechanic.
I will likely come back to this project on my own time as I'm still interested in fleshing out the concept.
