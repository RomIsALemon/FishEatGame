# FishEatGame (A.K.A. Always a Smaller Fish)
 
A godot project I had started, loosely based on Feeding Frenzy and those fake ads with the fish eating smaller fish to become a larger fish. 
I have begun expanding this project, turning it into a metroidvania-style exploration survival game where you can grow or stay small to access certain areas or questlines.
This project is still ongoing but is frequently added to!
